title: About
---

I have over 20 years of professional experience serving as a licensed clinical professional in a variety of environments. This extensive exposure to people from all walks of life with a wide range of challenges informs my approach.

I have learned successful therapy occurs in a trusting and compassionate therapeutic relationship. My style is warm, accepting and non-judgmental. The environment is calm and comfortable.

I customize treatment to meet your unique needs and provide practical steps to improve things right away. My approach incorporates focused solutions and in-depth psychotherapy to achieve insight and resolve underlying causes.

In my formal education and ongoing studies I strive to continually learn more about the mind/body connection. I use the latest research and practices to support clients to develop and integrate both body awareness and present-moment awareness. I have seen mindfulness empower my clients with deep confidence and greater clarity of goals. 

I'm also certified in Yoga-Informed Psychotherapy. If a client desires, we can incorporate trauma-sensitive yoga interventions to ease stress and tension held in the mind and body.
