Thanks for taking the time to learn a bit more about me.

I (she/her) have over 25 years of professional experience and love being a therapist. I’m a Licensed Clinical Professional Counselor (LCPC) in private practice that is named: Embodied Change, Inc.

I have worked in hospitals in Chicago and Atlanta, as well as community mental health clinics and group practices. This variety of environments exposed me to people from all walks of life and I honor and celebrate diversity.

I have learned successful therapy occurs in a trusting and compassionate therapeutic relationship. My style is warm, accepting, and non-judgmental.

I customize treatment to meet your unique needs and provide trauma-informed care along with practical steps to improve things right away. When treating shock trauma, I utilize Sensorimotor Psychotherapy (SP).  I am also a NARM Master Therapist.

What is NARM?  “The Neuro-Affective Relational Model (NARM) is an advanced clinical training for mental health professionals who work with complex trauma.   NARM is a cutting-edge model for addressing attachment, relational and developmental trauma, by working with the attachment patterns that cause life-long psychobiological symptoms and interpersonal difficulties. These early, unconscious patterns of disconnection deeply affect our identity, emotions, physiology, behavior, and relationships. Learning how to work simultaneously with these diverse elements is a radical shift that has profound clinical implications for healing complex trauma.  NARM emerged out of earlier psychotherapeutic orientations including Psychodynamic Psychotherapy, Attachment Theory, Cognitive Therapy, Gestalt Therapy, and Somatic Experiencing®, and bridges traditional psychotherapy with body-mind approaches within a context of relational practice. NARM is a mindfulness-based clinical treatment, as its method is grounded in a phenomenological approach to addressing identity and consciousness of self – who we truly are beneath these patterned ways of relating to ourselves and the world.”

In my formal education and ongoing studies, I strive to continually learn more about the mind/body connection. True change happens on a psychobiological level and must be embodied (Embodied Change.)  I use the latest research and practices to support clients to develop and integrate both body awareness and present-moment awareness. I have seen mindfulness empower my clients with deep confidence and greater clarity of goals.

I'm also certified in Yoga-Informed Psychotherapy. If a client desires, we can incorporate trauma-sensitive yoga interventions to ease stress and tension held in the mind and body. I began my career as a dancer and practiced as a Board-Certified Dance-Movement Therapist before acquiring advanced trauma training in Sensorimotor Psychotherapy (SP level 2) and NARM (level 3/master).
