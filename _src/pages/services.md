<q>By starting therapy you’ve already created a healthy change &mdash; you are no longer trying to do it alone.</q>

I meet with adolescents, adults and couples for short or long-term psychotherapy. During the initial session we discuss what is bringing you in, your goals for therapy and work together to design a plan to move forward.

#### Short Term:

I can provide counseling  focused on a specific problem in the present. At certain times in life, “another set of eyes” helps to generate solutions. It’s natural to want support to manage the stressors of modern life and everyone can benefit.

#### Long Term:

I can provide In-depth psychotherapy that focuses on understanding and insight as the catalyst for changing fundamental patterns of thinking, feeling and behaving.

#### Trauma Treatment:

My specialization is in trauma treatment and I utilize an integrated trauma therapy approach. I utilize a trauma-informed lens to identify, understand and resolve the effects trauma has on the whole person: mind, body, spirit and relationships.  I also incorporate Sensorimotor Psychotherapy (SP) blending somatic awareness and movement interventions, such as helping clients become aware of their bodies, track bodily sensations and implement physical actions that promote empowerment and competency.

Trauma treatment works best in the context of a relationship based on trust, respect, and compassion.

#### Couples Therapy:

I work with clients utilizing an Emotionally Focused Therapy (EFT) perspective. EFT focuses on creating and strengthening emotional bonds between partners by identifying and transforming the key moments that foster an adult loving relationship:  being open, attuned and responsive to each other.
